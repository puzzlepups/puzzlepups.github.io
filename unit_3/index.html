	<p>Every dog owner knows that their dog needs exercise to be healthy, but did you know that your dog also needs mental exercise? Have you ever come home to a war zone of torn up couch pillows or the contents of your garbage strewn about your house? After experiences like this with my puppy I knew there had to be a way to channel this pent up energy into a positive activity for both dog and owner. At Puzzles for Pups we play with every toy that is on our website to separate the winners from the duds. </p>
